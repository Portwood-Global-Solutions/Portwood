Use a condition when part of your document should appear only for certain records. Always test both outcomes and an empty value.

**Before you start:** Choose the fields and relationships in [Choose information](#choose-data). For an orientation and the format checklist, open [Find the right merge tag](#merge-tags).

#### Conditionals

#### Boolean conditional

```
{#IsActive}
  Account is active.
{/IsActive}

{#IsActive}
  Active.
{:else}
  Inactive.
{/IsActive}
```

Truthy values: Boolean `true`, non-empty lists, any non-null non-false non-empty-string value.

#### Inverse conditional

Show when falsy. Opposite of `{#Field}`.

```
{^Closed__c}
  Still open.
{/Closed__c}

{^IsActive}
  Inactive.
{:else}
  Active.
{/IsActive}
```

#### IF comparison expressions

Supports `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `=` (or `==`), `!=`. Values can be field refs, quoted strings, or numbers.

```
{#IF Amount > 100000}
  Large deal — requires approval.
{/IF}

{#IF StageName = 'Closed Won'}
  Congratulations!
{:else}
  Keep pushing.
{/IF}

{#IF Priority != 'Low'}
  Escalate this case.
{/IF}
```

String comparisons are case-sensitive.

#### AND / OR / NOT

Combine comparisons with boolean operators. Both word-form (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT` — case-insensitive) and symbolic form (`&&`, `||`, `!`) work. Parentheses control precedence.

```
{#IF Amount > 100000 AND Stage = 'Negotiation/Review'}
  Large deal in negotiation — escalate.
{/IF}

{#IF Stage = 'Closed Won' OR Stage = 'Closed - Pending Funding'}
  Pipeline closed.
{/IF}

{#IF NOT IsPrivate__c}
  Public record.
{/IF}
```

Default precedence (highest first): `NOT` → comparisons → `AND` → `OR`. Use parens to override:

```
{#IF (Amount > 100000 OR Strategic__c) AND IsClosed = false}
  Large or strategic, still open.
{/IF}
```

Arbitrarily long chains and grouping work:

```
{#IF (Region = 'NA') OR (Region = 'EU' AND Tier__c = 'Gold') OR (Strategic__c)}
  Eligible for premium support.
{/IF}
```

Quoted strings are opaque — `AND` / `OR` inside quotes is treated as part of the string, not as an operator.

#### Nested IF blocks

`{#IF}…{/IF}` blocks can be nested arbitrarily deep. Common pattern: an outer IF gates a whole section, inner IFs gate sub-sections within it.

```
{#IF Work_Tasks__r.totalSize != 0}
  WORK TASKS
  …table with Work Tasks loop…
  {#IF Work_Task_Step_Count__c != 0}
    …Steps table with Steps loop…
  {/IF}
{/IF}
```

`Rel.totalSize` returns 0 (not null) when the child relationship is empty, so `{#IF Rel.totalSize != 0}` is the canonical "render this section if there are rows" check.
